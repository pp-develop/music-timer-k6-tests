Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)

You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you not to exercise these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the recipients that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

This License refers to version 2 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" means the copyright of the original authors of the Program.

"Program" means any work covered by this License.

"Source code" means the preferred form of the Program for making modifications to it.

"Object code" means any non-source form of the Program.

"Work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.

"Secondary Section" means a named appendix or a similar section of the documentation that comes with the Program. A "Secondary Section" does not include the text of the License itself, and the only other texts that are included in it are the title and license notices.

"Contribution" means any addition to or change to the Program that has been added or changed by someone other than the original authors. If you have contributed any code or documentation to the Program, you must include your name and the date on which you contributed it.

1. Source Code.

The Program is distributed in source code form. You may make copies of the source code, and distribute it to others under the terms of this License.

2. Distribution of the Program.

You may distribute copies of the Program under the terms of this License. You may charge a fee for copying or distributing the Program, but you must include a copy of this License with each copy of the Program.

3. Modifications.

You may modify the Program and distribute the modified version under the terms of this License. You must include a prominent notice stating that you have changed the Program and the date of the change.

4. Copyleft.

All copies of the Program, including modifications and derivative works, must be licensed under this License. This means that you must distribute copies of the Program, including modifications, under the same terms as this License.

5. No Warranty.

There is no warranty for the Program. If the Program is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipient should be aware that it is not the original Program and the authors are not responsible for any issues arising from the modified version.

6. Patents.

If you hold a patent that would be infringed by the Program, you must grant a license to use that patent to everyone who has the right to use the Program. Otherwise, you may not distribute the Program.

7. Termination.

If you violate the terms of this License, your license to distribute the Program will be terminated. You may be able to reinstate it if you remedy the violation and comply with the terms of this License.

8. Acceptance.

By copying, distributing, or modifying the Program (or any work based on it), you indicate your acceptance of this License and agree to abide by its terms.
